This is my personal pick on how a personal finance management system should look like.

== Technologies used

* PostgreSQL -- I like it, I need and want to learn it, and it makes it easy to use either local or remote DB
* Qt -- quite a good GUI framework, and I _don't_ want any JavaScript here
* PySide6 -- at least for now, the GUI is in Python -- I need to get it up & running as quick as possible
* Python -- seems like a good scripting choice... but I'm considering Lua as well...
